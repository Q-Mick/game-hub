# React TypeScript App with ChakraUI - AXIOS
This repository contains a React app built as part of my journey to learn coding using React and TypeScript. The app is an exercise, that I did to help get familiar with the fundamentals of typescript and React as I primarily use Vue and want to expand my skills, I utilized the Chakra UI library for efficient component building, and integrating Axios for making HTTP requests to the RAWG API.
The app is a platform for exploring and displaying information from the RAWG database in a clean and efficient manner.

# My achievments
Gained a solid understanding of react and typescript fundamentals.
Built a Responsive layout using ChakraUI and a grid system.
Added a light / dark mode.
Implemented skeleton loaders.
Implemented Search / Genre / Platform filters
Handle errors when unable to fetch data.
Created a generic data hook in order to quickly add other hooks such as useGames, useGenres, usePlatforms.
Implemented a gameQuery Object to use when making http requests, via AXIOS to the RAWG API.

** RAWG API seems to have an error when requesting to view titles on the Playstation platform
